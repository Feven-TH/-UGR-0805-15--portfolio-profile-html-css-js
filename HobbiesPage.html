      <h3>Spiritual Service</h3>
      <img src="Images/photo_2024-11-23_13-30-01.jpg" alt="church" />
      <p>
        Spiritual service is an important part of my life. I’m involved in
        church activities like group prayers, Bible studies, and discussions,
        and I’m always learning through the courses I take at church. Serving
        others in my community has been a rewarding experience, and it’s helped
        me strengthen my faith while building deeper connections with those
        around me.

      <h3>Books</h3>
      <img src="Images/OIP.jpg" alt="book" />
      <p>
        Reading has always been a way for me to escape into new worlds and
        expand my mind. Whether it’s a gripping novel, an insightful history
        book, or a spiritual writing, I love how books can transport me and
        offer new perspectives. Some authors have really stuck with me, shaping
        how I see the world.

      <h3>Movies</h3>
      <img src="Images/photo_2024-11-23_12-51-37.jpg" alt="movie" />
      <p>
        Watching movies is one of my favorite pastimes. I enjoy a mix of genres,
        but I especially love thrillers, mystery, thought-provoking themes, or
        moments of joy and laughter. Classic Hollywood films and early 2000s
        movies often captivate me the most.

      <h3>Discussions</h3>
      <img src="Images/ua8fjfif.png" alt="discussion" />
      <p>
        I enjoy meaningful discussions on societal, cultural, spiritual,
        political, and historical topics. Debating ideas challenges me to think
        critically and deepen my understanding of the world. Listening to
        podcasts sparks new ideas and broadens my knowledge. However, it’s the
        conversations and debates that truly energize and help me grow.
