        <h3>LCCS</h3>
        <p>
          I attended Lideta Catholic Cathedral School (LCCS), where I maintained
          a strong GPA and earned several merit awards. My high school years
          were filled with growth and opportunities as I joined the STEM club
          and served as vice president of the women’s tennis club. These
          experiences shaped my leadership skills and deepened my passion for
          learning and innovation.

        <h3>Laura Academy</h3>
        <p>
          I began my educational journey at Laura Academy, where my curiosity
          and love for learning flourished. Excelling in all subjects, I
          consistently ranked at the top of my class. Beyond academics, I
          participated in clubs like 'Explore Ethiopia' and 'Mini Media,' and I
          proudly represented my school in competitions such as spelling bees,
          general knowledge contests, and curricular question challenges across
          multiple platforms.
